In tmux how can I rename a window while I'm in the session and window I want to rename?


### Assistant

Press `Ctrl-b` (default prefix) followed by `,` (comma).

This will open a prompt at the bottom of the screen where you can type the new name and press Enter.

> I'll create a concise Lua snippet for a Neovim plugin that uses Telescope to pick an LLM model from a list and update or insert a `Model: <name>` line near the top of a markdown buffer. The snippet searches the first lines for an existing model line, updates it if found, or inserts a new one; it uses appropriate Telescope APIs with attach_mappings to handle selection.
